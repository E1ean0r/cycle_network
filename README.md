# How far can you bike?

### Description 

The UK has provided a vector geospatial dataset of the National Cycle Network, which was the main dataset used for this study. A repository was created in GitHUB and Jupyter notebooks was used to code the tool using python. The tool works by inputting lat long coordinates of your location and calculates the closest point on the National Cycle Network. From this a distance buffer is applied to calculate the furthest points along the network cyclists can make within the timeframe, and thus the different routes with can be taken.
